# GitHub API Exercise

This is a simple exercise in backend Node.js to demonstrate coding skills and familiarity with concepts such as APIs, synchronous vs. asynchronous programming, etc.

Tools used include:
-   Node.js version 10.16.0
-   Axios version 0.19.0
-   GitHub GraphQL API v4
-   AWS Elastic Beanstalk Sample Node.js App
-   PHPStorm 

To fill in the gaps in my personal knowledge, I primarily consulted the following resources:
-   [Introductin to Node.js on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/node-intro/table-of-contents)
- [GraphQL API Reference on Github](https://developer.github.com/v4/)
- [AWS Documentation for Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/GettingStarted.html) 

## Roadmap*
(AKA Things I would do if this were a real project)

- Utilize a real front-end templating framework
- Add the ability to look up any user's public repositories
- Better structure the code for extensibility and reuse

## Setup
- Install Node and NPM
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in the project root
- Set an environment variable for `github_token` ([more info](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line))
- Run `npm start` in the project root
- Visit 127.0.0.1:3000 and see the list of your repositories.
